# Word2Vec-and-PCA
In this project I have taken the sentiment140 dataset. It contains 1,600,000 tweets extracted using the twitter api. The tweets have been labeled (0 = negative, 4 = positive).
Here I have shown tokenization, vectorization on tweets.
For visualising both the positive and negative tweets I have used Word2Vec and PCA. I have ploted it on PLOTLY.
Each tweet is each dot here. Blue dots are positive tweet and the orange dots are negative tweets. 
This is a proper visualisation of both positive and negative tweets on the full dataset.
